Learning bioinformatics can be approached in various ways, such as through courses or internships. However, in my view, the most effective method for both beginners and experts is to practice with open-source research publications, focusing on data exploration and computational reproducibility. This approach not only allows for gaining insights into current trends but also equips individuals to handle data in diverse ways.

Initially, incomplete details and data inaccessibility often led me to abandon my practice work in midway. Moreover, the required information depends on how far you are going to reproduce the results, whether limited to upstream analysis or extended to downstream analysis. On the other hand, you may try to bring the same results with different methods. So, Creating a checklist before jumping into the analysis helps to determine the necessary data and plan accordingly. Furthermore, numerous nuances exist depending on the conducted studies on the research paper. I aim to address some of those points here.

Considerations for both Upstream and Downstream Analysis:

1. Availability of Metadata/ Supplementary data/ Supporting information (contains accession numbers for datasets, Patient details, condition-specific classification, timeline, Count matrix, DEG data, result summaries in Excel, etc)
2. Access to the full paper, Results, and figures to get in-depth insights into the study and data handling methods.
3. Detailed Materials and Methods
4. Take a note of the containerization details (Ex: Docker, singularity), libraries/software tools, and their versions used at every step in the analysis. (Different versions may lead to result discrepancies)
5. Evaluate the complexity and transparency of the data processing pipelines used in the analysis.
6. Consider whether the research paper has received feedback or validation from the scientific community. Papers that have been cited, replicated, or discussed by other researchers may offer more confidence in the reproducibility of the results.
7. Most importantly the usage of the data should adhere to the ethical guidelines in the research conduct and reporting.
Upstream Analysis:

This phase consists of the following steps Quality control, Trimming, Aligning/Mapping to reference genome or transcriptome. where the raw data is processed to extract meaningful information.

1. Ensure that sequencing datasets are publicly available or accessible upon request.
2. file formats (Fastq, BAM, etc) and their fetching options (SRA data, AWS cloud delivery, Google Cloud, etc)
3. Sequencing type (Single-end/ Paired-end)
4. Versions of the reference genome, transcriptome, and GTF file(Gene Transfer Format).
Downstream Analysis:

Once the data is clean and aligned, downstream analysis focuses on extracting biological insights from the processed data. This involves tasks like identifying differentially expressed genes (in RNA sequencing), calling variants (in DNA sequencing), performing pathway enrichment analysis to understand the biological pathways involved, functional annotation, data manipulation, visualization, and interpreting the results. Downstream analysis is where the biological meaning of the data is uncovered and interpreted.

1. Check if the paper provides code or scripts for data analysis, as it allows you to run the same analysis on the dataset and verify the reported results.
2. Look for detailed explanations of each step, parameter settings, and any assumptions made during the analysis. Well-documented code makes it easier to understand and reproduce the analysis.
3. Look for validation studies or follow-up analyses that have independently verified the findings reported in the paper. Reproducibility is strengthened when multiple studies corroborate the same results.

  By considering these points, you can better assess the suitability of a research paper for computational reproducibility and make informed decisions when selecting papers for your analysis.
